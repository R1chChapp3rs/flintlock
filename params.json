Flintlock currently only supports a handful of features, but that's expected to change with time (and SDK availability, perhaps!).  The main features currently include:\r\n\r\n* Controlling slideshow presentations (tested with PPT) and music with the media controls\r\n\r\nThat's pretty much it.  This is what it looks like:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](images/flintlock.png)\r\n\r\nSending the currently playing song in a variety of media players to the Pebble is a work in progress.  Next on the planning are an option to lock the computer when the connection is unexpectedly lost and more importantly firmware/app management.  If you have any suggestions beyond that, feel free to [post them as an issue](https://github.com/barometz/flintlock/issues/new).\r\n\r\n### Releases\r\nOccasionally a version of Flintlock will be considered sufficiently stable and non-explody to be marked as a release and packaged.  The current (and inevitably slightly outdated) release is [0.6.0](https://github.com/barometz/flintlock/tree/flintlock-0.6.0). \r\n\r\n* [Binary download, 7zip](release/flintlock-0.6.0.7z)\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\nFlintlock would not have existed without the wonderful work of @Hexxeh and all other contributors to Hexxeh/libpebble.","google":"UA-39515137-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
