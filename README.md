flintlock
=========

Flintlock is a Windows application that interacts with Pebble smartwatches using the flint library.  So 
far only tested with Windows 7 32-bit, but anything from 2000 and up is expected to work.

Binaries can be had at http://barometz.name/pebble/ - after pairing your Pebble with your computer everything 
should work pretty much automagically, although no guarantees are made.  Some strange behaviour is currently 
expected after a failed reconnection attempt, this can be reset by scanning again or restarting the application.
