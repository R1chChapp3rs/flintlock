        <h3>Flintlock!</h3>

<p>As you may have guessed, Flintlock is a Windows application you can use to connect your Pebble smartwatch directly to your computer in order to do neat stuff.  Flintlock currently only supports a handful of features, but that's expected to change with time (and SDK availability, perhaps!).  The main features currently include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Controlling slideshow presentations (tested with PPT) and music with the media controls</li>
</ul><p>That's pretty much it.  This is what it looks like:</p>

<p>Sending the currently playing song in a variety of media players to the Pebble is a work in progress.  Next on the planning are an option to lock the computer when the connection is unexpectedly lost and more importantly firmware/app management.  If you have any suggestions beyond that, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/barometz/flintlock/issues/new">post them as an issue</a>.</p>

<h3>Releases</h3>

<p>Occasionally a version of Flintlock will be considered sufficiently stable and non-explody to be marked as a release and packaged.  The current (and inevitably slightly outdated) release is <a href="https://github.com/barometz/flintlock/tree/flintlock-0.5">0.5.4825.30142</a>, which tells me that I need to do something about the numbering scheme as this autogenerated stuff just looks silly.  </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="release/flintlock-0.5.7z">Binary download, 7zip</a></li>
</ul><h3>Thanks</h3>

<p>Flintlock would not have existed without the wonderful work of <a href="https://github.com/Hexxeh" class="user-mention">@Hexxeh</a> and all other contributors to Hexxeh/libpebble.</p>
